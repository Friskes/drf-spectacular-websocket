# Contribution Guide üìñ

> First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üòá

Contributions include but are not restricted to:
- Reporting bugs
- Contributing to code
- Writing tests
- Writing documentation

## A recommended flow of contributing to an Open Source project

1. First, [fork](https://github.com/Friskes/drf-spectacular-websocket/fork) this [project](https://github.com/Friskes/drf-spectacular-websocket) to your own namespace using the fork button at the top right of the repository page.

2. Clone your fork repository to local:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/drf-spectacular-websocket.git
    ```

3. Add the fork as a new remote:
    ```bash
    git remote add fork https://github.com/YOURNAME/drf-spectacular-websocket.git
    git fetch fork
    ```

## Local development

> We recommend working in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). Feel free to create a virtual environment with either the venv module or the virtualenv tool. For example:

1. Create virtual environment
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    . venv/bin/activate  # linux
    venv/Scripts/activate  # windows
    ```

2. Install development dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install ."[dev]"  # linux
    pip install .[dev]  # windows
    ```

3. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

4. (Optional) Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to run linters and formatters.
    > This step is optional and will be executed automatically by git before you make a commit, but you may want to run it manually in order to apply fixes.

#### Now, all dependencies are installed into the Python environment you chose, which will be used for development after this point üéâ.

## Making changes to the project

> Don't modify code on the main branch, the main branch should always keep track of origin/main üí°.

1. (Optional) To update main branch to date:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    # In rare cases that your local main branch diverges from the remote main:
    git fetch origin && git reset --hard main
    ```

2. Create a new branch based on the up-to-date main branch for new patches.

> Code should be [Pythonic and zen](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)

- All functions, methods, classes, and attributes should be documented with a docstring. We use the [Google docstring style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
    > If you come across a function or method that doesn't conform to this standard, please update it as you go

- Writing and running tests
    - Tests are contained within the `tests` directory, and follow the same directory structure as the `drf_spectacular_websocket` module. If you are adding a test case, it should be located within the correct submodule of `tests`. E.g., tests for `drf_spectacular_websocket/schemas/schema.py` reside in `tests/schemas/test_schema.py`.

3. Make your changes

4. Make sure that nothing is broken after making changes and all tests are checked.
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    > The test suite is still simple and needs expansion! Please help write more test cases.

5. Commit your changes to git üìù. We follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) which are enforced using a pre-commit hook.

6. Push the changes to your fork

7. Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) üì•. *(using the `pull request` button at the top right of the repository page)*. Give the pull request a descriptive title indicating what it changes. The style of the PR title should also follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

8. Go to the [Release Action](https://github.com/Friskes/drf-spectacular-websocket/actions/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml) and make sure that the workflow was successful ‚úÖ.

9. Wait until the pull request is accepted by the repository owner ‚è≥.
